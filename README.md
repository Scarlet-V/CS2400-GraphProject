# CS2400-GraphProject



## Task 1
This version of Graph class uses Adjacency list for graph representation and Breadth first traversal has been demonstrated.
Main function has been written to demonstrate the adjacency list representation and BFS.
**Instructions**: Begin with adding the first node and add all nodes that connects to that first node one by one in their own line of code. From there, add the second node that connects to third and so on.
## Task 2
This version of Graph class uses Adjacency matrix for graph representation and Depth first traversal has been demonstrated.
Main function has been written to demonstrate the matrix representation and iterative DFS using stack.
**Instructions:** Begin with adding the first node and add all nodes that connects to that first node one by one in their own line of code. From there, add the second node that connects to third and so on. This will display the path of the desired node as it performs a depth-first tranversal. A one will indicate if the node is passed connected to another node. Align the top and left side nodes as if they were x and y coordinates.
